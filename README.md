**[scalingo-cli](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/cli/start) plugin for the [asdf version manager](https://asdf-vm.com).**

</div>

> This asdf plugin also work nicely with [**rtx**](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx) which is a fork of
asdf in Rust, with better performance and more features.
> **I recommend using `rtx` instead of `asdf` for a better usage experience** (see https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/issues/290).

# Usage

## Architecture Override

The `ASDF_SCALINGO_CLI_OVERWRITE_ARCH` variable can be used to override the architecture that is
used for determining which Scalingo CLI release download. Useful, for example, for allowing users
on M1 Macs to install amd64 binary when there's no arm64 binary available when using old Scalingo
CLI versions.
